MLS Money Ball Project 
Spencer Hodapp

The overarching objective of the MLS Money Ball Project is to furnish teams with a competitive edge in talent acquisition and roster construction, 
thereby introducing a data-driven paradigm to leverage the landscape of MLS roster rules and elevate overall team performance. 
This is accomplished by directing focus towards the lower parts of the Senior roster, specifically targeting players classified below TAM signings, excluding goalkeepers. 
This strategic approach is intended to empower teams in making judicious decisions pertaining to player acquisitions, inter-league trades, contract negotiations 
and promotions to the first team. 
At the core of this undertaking lies the implementation of a multi-model K-means algorithm, 
designed to identify boundary players who surpass anticipated performance levels within their respective local clusters. 
These clusters are delineated based on positional roles and the distribution of performance expectations.
The intended effect is to enable an end user to provide a suitable short list of players who fit a certain criterion asked for by coaching staff 
(i.e. ‘A ball playing center back replacement’)
