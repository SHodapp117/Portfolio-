Phase One: Establishing baselines:

* Took the Statsbomb Intro to Football Analytics to familiarize myself with core concepts and vocabulary.
* Watched David Beckham's & Landon Donovan's 'Detail' to learn how to break down play and what to look for.
* Went through Statsbomb Github to look at documentation and data.
* Looked at leading members of the football analysis communities' think pieces and research papers.

Phase Two: Project Selection

* Had conversations with Grant Rhines, Harrison Greenfield & Calvin Smith to learn more about AGM and role + expectations. Ran proposed project past them, revised to do an opposition analysis to highlight spatiotemporal analysis along with visualization skill, as asked for in the job description.
* Performed EDA for Spain vs. Switzerland to gain a baseline understanding of information recorded and explore possible angles of dissection.
* Began developing a core theme to explore and focused on the PowerPoint format to highlight the ability to explain technical findings to a non-technical audience.
* Took a full 24 hrs to think and reflect on decisions to ensure solid logic and reasoning.

Phase Three: Building

* Developed the key report utilizing skills in Python to develop reproducible and automatable code cells.
* Decided to record the presentation to highlight thinking and 'soccer knowledge' without overrunning the word limit on the project report.
* Project was completed on 2/1.
